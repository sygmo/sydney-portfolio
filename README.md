# Summary:

![screenshot of portfolio page](./assets/images/portfolio.png)

This project is a personal portfolio website made completely from scratch for a UT Coding Bootcamp assignment. I intend to make real use of it in the future, so it is very much a work in progress. 

All links work, including the link to my resume, and the layout is responsive and will appear differently on mobile.
